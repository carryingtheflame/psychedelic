Psychedelic substances can carry medical and legal risks; individual reactions vary and serious adverse events can occur. If you have a medical or psychiatric condition (including pregnancy), take multiple medications, or are unsure about safety, consult a qualified healthcare professional before using psychedelics. In an emergency, seek immediate medical care or call your local emergency number. Use at your own risk.

# Harm reduction tips

- **Before the session**
  - Don’t stop or change prescription meds without talking to your prescriber.
  - Tell your prescriber if you plan to use psychedelics and get medical clearance when needed (especially for multiple serotonergic drugs, seizure history, bipolar, pregnancy, heart issues).
  - Bring a written meds list and any emergency prescriptions (naloxone, benzodiazepine) and emergency contacts.
  - If you take multiple serotonergic medications, check with your clinician first.

- **Dosing and preparation**
  - Start low and test your response before taking larger doses.
  - Use an accurate scale and be confident about what you have.
  - Consider making tea or lemon tek to reduce nausea and speed onset.

- **During the session**
  - Have a sober, trusted person present who knows your medical needs and how to seek help.
  - Prepare a comfortable, low-stimulation space and plan for aftercare (rest, hydration, someone to check in).

- **If medical issues arise**
  - Don’t mix drugs or add medications during the session without medical advice.
  - Have a basic medical plan written down (current meds, seizure plan, allergies).
  - If you or your sitter are unsure about a dangerous reaction, seek emergency medical help.

- **Final checklist**
  - Prescriber clearance or discussion
  - Written meds list + emergency contacts
  - Emergency prescriptions on hand (if applicable)
  - Accurate scale and verified product
  - Sober, informed sitter
  - Comfortable setting and aftercare plan
  - Start with a low test dose before larger dosing

# Practical insights from experience

- **Personal or Family History of Psychosis**
    - If you have a personal history of psychosis (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or a psychotic episode), do not use psychedelics — they can greatly increase the risk of worsening psychosis, prolonged psychotic states, hospitalization, or dangerous behavior.

    - A family history of psychosis (first-degree relative) also raises risk; discuss with a psychiatrist before considering psychedelics.

    - Psychosis risk factors include: past psychotic breaks, early-onset severe mental illness, hearing voices or strong paranoia, and poorly controlled mood or thought disorders.

    - Even without a formal diagnosis, if you experience symptoms like persistent hallucinations, delusions, severe dissociation, or ongoing paranoia, avoid psychedelics and seek psychiatric evaluation first.

    - If you are taking antipsychotic medications, do not stop them to take psychedelics without psychiatric guidance — stopping can trigger relapse.

    - If you have any doubt, get a psychiatric assessment and written clearance before proceeding. The potential harms are serious; when in doubt, avoid use.

- **Diabetes**
  - If you use insulin, bring your glucose meter and test strips. Low blood sugar can feel like sweating, shakiness, confusion, fast heart rate — which can be scary during a trip.
  - Eat something before the session and keep a quick snack (juice, glucose tabs, sandwich) nearby in case your blood sugar drops.
  - GLP-1 drugs (Ozempic, Mounjaro, Trulicity, etc.) can slow digestion. That can make mushroom effects start later, last longer, and increase nausea. Be prepared for delayed onset and a longer session.

- **Bipolar disorder**
  - If you have bipolar I (mania is prominent), psychedelic trips are not recommended.
  - If you have bipolar II (depression is the main issue), psychedelics may be tried but carry risk. There are reports of new or worsened mania, sleep disruption, and need for medication afterward.
  - Many antipsychotics and some mood stabilizers can block psychedelic effects.
  - Don’t stop prescribed meds on your own. Only consider tapering with your prescriber’s guidance.
  - Lithium and haloperidol are generally not advised with psychedelics — don’t mix without medical advice.

- **Seizure disorder**
  - There’s little data. Clinical studies usually exclude people with a history of seizures.
  - Before using, note what seizure medicine you take, how well it controls seizures, how often seizures happen, and have a plan if one occurs.
  - Benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam) can stop a seizure but also blunt the psychedelic experience — keep that in mind if rescue meds may be needed.
  - Some antiepileptic drugs are linked to increased suicidal thoughts; plan integration and check-ins after the session.

- **Parkinson’s disease**
  - Some people report symptom relief with psilocybin, but interactions with Parkinson’s meds can cause stronger movements (dyskinesia) or feeling “too much” medication.
  - If you rely on Parkinson’s medicines, think about a plan with your prescriber or start with a conservative change during the session day (for example, reduce one dose if safe) and monitor closely rather than stopping meds outright.
  - Ropinirole and other dopamine agonists have been reported to increase nausea, twitches, impulsive behaviors, headaches, sleep problems — watch for these.
  - For microdosing, many keep their meds and start very low, watching for side effects.

- **Spastic pain, spinal cord injury, paralysis**
  - Use psychedelics with caution. There are reports of increased spasticity (muscle tightness) and high body temperature with psilocybin or LSD.
  - Consider having a muscle relaxant available (e.g., cyclobenzaprine, methocarbamol, baclofen) and check with your clinician about safety beforehand.

# Harm-reduction for psilocybin

- **Start with a small test dose.** If you’re on a medication that might reduce effects (like an SSRI), take a small “tester” dose first so you can tell how you respond. A common tester is about 1 gram of dried mushrooms (≈10 mg psilocybin). Do this at home or at the start of your session.

- **How to read the tester:**
  - If you feel a mild, noticeable effect from the tester, take a normal full dose next (about 2–3.5 g dried, ≈20–35 mg psilocybin).
  - If you feel nothing from the tester, use a higher full dose (about 3.5–5 g dried, ≈35–50 mg psilocybin).
  - If you’re still unsure, try a larger tester (for example 2 g ≈20 mg psilocybin) before your main session to check sensitivity.

- **Don’t assume SSRIs always mean you need more.** Some people on SSRIs respond normally, others don’t. A practical approach is to take a regular dose first and only give yourself a larger booster if the first dose does little.

- **Ways to prepare and reduce nausea:**
  - Many people make mushroom tea or use “lemon tek” (soak ground mushrooms in lemon juice briefly) — these often reduce nausea, but can speed and intensify onset.
  - Ginger tea (steep fresh ginger 15–20 minutes, strain and drink) helps nausea for many people.
  - Avoid extreme fasting as very low blood sugar can cause nausea. Eat a light, low-fat snack if needed.

- **About serotonin syndrome and stopping SSRIs:**
  - Serotonin syndrome after psilocybin is rare, but risk is higher if you’re taking several drugs that affect serotonin.
  - Don’t stop or taper your SSRI just to take psilocybin without talking to your prescriber. Tapering can take weeks–months and often causes withdrawal or return of symptoms.
  - If you’re stable on an SSRI, many people still have meaningful experiences with a normal or slightly increased dose.

(Abilify can be used  off-label for other issues like depression etc). Abilify will likely decrease the effect of psilocybin but if the dose of Abilify is low at 1-2mg the psilocybin could still have an effect. To taper or not is really up to the person. People have had bad adverse effects (mania) from tapering down to zero mg too quickly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | --                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | --                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Gabapentin is sedating and can cause confusion and drowsiness but if someone has been on it a while and has a tolerance they may not get those side effects anymore.  It can cause withdrawals if stopped abruptly so if they've been on it a while be careful to only skip one dose or day of dosing max. You may need to increase the dose of psilocybin with this med. The blunting effect is likely dose-dependant. So higher doses of gabapentin will be more blunting. Use a minimize as tolerated approach to Gabapentin in the days/weeks before the session..                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | --                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | --                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Expect something similar from Lyrica. If they're on a low dose of Lyrica maybe the psilocybin could work. The blunting effect is likely dose-dependant. So higher doses of Lyrica will be more blunting. Use a minimize as tolerated approach in the days/weeks before the session. Withdrawal on this is quite unpleasant.

Can be treated like an SSRI with a few extra side effects to keep in mind: TCAs (Amitriptyline) can increase the risk of QT prolongation. Ask person if their doctor is monitoring their heart.

But a severe case looks like seizures fainting dizziness etc. The cardiac risks from psilocybin typically come after longer term exposure like daily microdosing.

Strongly advised not to use.                                          | The psychoactive effects of THC are primarily mediated by the activation of (mostly G-coupled) cannabinoid receptors which result in a decrease in the concentration of the second messenger molecule cAMP through inhibition of adenylate cyclase. Half life of inhaled THC is 6 minutes but due to fat stores can have an upper end half life of 22 hours so it can take up to 4.5 DAYS to be cleared from the body.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | May increase or decrease the effects of psychedelics depending on how much they use. Ask person about THC use patterns and doses. Heavy cannabis use decreases emotional processing and can be emotionally numbing like benzodiapines. Infrequent cannabis use can increase emotional processing when it is used. Can use the minimize as tolerated approach or better yet have them taper off before a session.    When people are using cannabis daily for medical purposes it it recommended to take 3 day breaks periodically to reset their tolerance. But some people do experience withdrawal effects like irritability headache restlessness. It may be best to have them skip taking cannabis just the day of the session. Maybe try to get them to use minimally in the days before.          --(Note: CBD appears to be ok in combo with psychedelics)                             | --                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | If you use cannabis: stopping before a session is recommended — cannabis can dull insights or block the medicine for some people.

However a low ph of acid in the stomach helps to break down the mushrooms fiberous structure and is thought to reduce nausea and aid digestion.  There has been some discussion on whether a low stomach acid is needed to convert psilocybin to psilocin (psychoactive metabolite). The experimental and observed data do not always match here. Using the Lemon tek method will help break down the mushrooms and adds acidic ph to the dose which is really helpful for people on this medication.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | --                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Lemon tek/tea: soaking ground mushrooms in lemon juice or making tea can reduce nausea and make effects come on faster.

But you may want to decrease the dose of the carbidopa-levodopa the day of the session if the person is not too dependent on it to get best results of psilocybin session and to decrease excessive movement side effects with carbidopa-levodopa.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | There's less info out there about mdma and carbidopa-levodopa.
